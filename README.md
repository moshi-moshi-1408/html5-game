# HTML5 Game

This is a 2D arcade game written entirely in pure JavaScript and rendered on HTML5 <canvas>.

The objective of the game is to avoid getting hit by the falling objects under 20 seconds.  The player starts out with 3 lives and decreases every time they are hit by an object.  The game character can be controlled by using left or right keystrokes or using the mouse.
